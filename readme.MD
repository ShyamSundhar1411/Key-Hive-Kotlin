## Permissions

KeyHive uses **All Files Access Permission** for exporting password data to a CSV file.  
This permission is essential because the app needs to write files directly to the local storage. Due to the nature of password data, which must remain secure and private, using a cloud-based approach or shared storage is not feasible. By exporting to a local CSV file, users retain complete control over their data without involving third-party services.

More privacy-friendly best practices such as **Storage Access Framework** or **Media Store API** are not suitable for this use case because:
1. **Complete User Control**: KeyHive provides full user control over exported data, allowing them to choose exact file paths and manage their backups manually.
2. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Since the app deals with highly sensitive information, exporting directly to local storage ensures that the data remains within the user’s device without any risk of external exposure.
3. **Offline Functionality**: KeyHive is designed to work entirely offline, ensuring user privacy. Using shared storage APIs would introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce control over file placement.
